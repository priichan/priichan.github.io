# Personal Website
After I attended a one day workshop at UC Davis that described the basics of making your own website using HTML and CSS, I decided to take on this project for personal development purposes. Thus, I researched further and found that with the help of a bootstrap template and GitHub, I could easily personalize [a website that can showcase my skills and experience](https://priichan.github.io/).

# Helpful Websites
These were the websites that I mainly visited to progress further in my website's development:
- codecademy.com for learning HTML and CSS
- w3schools.com for learning HTML and CSS
- startbootstrap.com for letting me use the foundation of my website as a starting point
- github.com for letting me manage my code and host my website

# Moving Further
Now that I have more experience in using HTML and CSS, I am currently working on a revamped version of my personal website where the website is made from scratch and not with bootstrap.
