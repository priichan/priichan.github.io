            <p class="mb-5">I am a third year undergraduate UC Davis student, studying Biomedical Engineering with a specialization in Medical Devices. I am interested in coming up with mechanical solutions to health issues through the use of  programming and circuitry. I hope to explore a variety of opportunities which will allow me to incorporate these skills into the development of new  medical technology.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">At the start of this school quarter, I participated in the 2018 UC Davis Make-a-Thon, where teams of five participants had 48 hours to create a device that prepares custom immunodiffusion plates to diagnose patients for Coccidioidomycosis. Although the competition was stressful due to time constraints, it was still a lot of fun and I feel like I learned a lot about the device production process. In addition to the competition, I attended Varian's University Day, where I got to tour the company and meet hiring managers. Since I had a great time speaking with recruiters about their internship postings, I am actively pursuing other opportunities to speak with company employees. Therefore, I have plans to attend this quarter's Career Fairs along with company info meetings on campus. I am also keeping an eye on emails and company websites for any other great opportunities.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Outside of my school life, I like to use my time to learn about the people and culture around me. I enjoy meeting and connecting with new people by working on projects or playing board games together. I also love to try culturally diverse food, explore different arts and crafts, and read a variety of cross-cultural literature.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Davis, CA</div>
              <p>Programmed a mazebuilder code with C programming to let a user turn a grid into a maze by breaking the user desired grid walls. The program starts by asking the user for the number of rows and columns desired, and then generates a grid accordingly. Next, the program asks the user for two cell numbers (each cell is designated by a row and column number) which holds the wall that should be broken. If the two cells are directly next to each other (and not diagonal), the grid should be regenerated with the desired wall deleted. If the two cells are not adjacent, there will be a notification and a prompt to try again.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Davis, CA</div>
              <p>Programmed a MATLAB audio file editor interface with a team of three students. The program allows a user to upload any audio file (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, etc.) and edit the file using different effects (speed and volume control, fast forward, rewind, reverse the audio file, echo, remove voice, treble, base, stereo, mono). The user is then able to save the file with the edits. Another feature of the program allows the user to play three different sound waves (sine, square, sawtooth waves), observe their graphs, and save the sounds to their computer.</p>
                <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2plxlYXgQFQ&feature=share">youtube video</a> was made to explain how the editor works, and the MATLAB code was uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/priichan/Audio-File-Editor">GitHub</a>.</p>

                <p>Our design consisted of a strip of cardboard that could be folded into a square stack (size was about three by three inches). When unfolded, the user puts one foot on one square of the strip, and the other portion folds to make a wall with a hook (a guitar pick hook), which will assist the user in tying the shoelaces.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">2018 UC Davis Make-a-Thon (Davis, CA)</div>
                <p>Competed for 48 hours in a team of five students, where each team required at least two lowerclassmen and at least two upperclassmen. Utilized Autodesk Fusion 360 to design a device that produced custom immunodiffusion plates, which are used in the UC Davis Coccidioidomycosis Serology lab to diagnose patients for Coccidioidomycosis. Won the “Most Creative Team” award.</p>
                <p>Our design had to cut out seven wells in a petri dish as consistently and as efficiently as possible. Our team decided to utilize a spirograph idea with three gears in order to ensure that vacuum tubing (attached to the top of our design) is able to suck the cut-out wells one at a time. We chose not to suck out all seven wells at once because we decided that even if the vacuum was strong enough, the vacuum might not work as we wished it to. In the end, our design only required a user to push the top portion of the device down for about five seconds before releasing. This is a huge improvement from the current lab usage time of about fifteen seconds, which does not utilize any device created from the competition.</p>

              <p>Promoted Biomedical Engineering at Engineering Day by speaking to high school students and facilitating a water balloon helmet activity. Also advised incoming students about college and UC Davis.</p>
                <p>For the water balloon helmet activity, a water balloon represented a patient's head, and recycled material is utilized to create a helmet for the water balloon. The helmet could not cover the "face" of the balloon, and it could not be thicker than two inches. Once the helmet is finished and attached to the water balloon, the whole system is dropped from various heights until the water balloon pops. The purpose was to demonstrate the engineering design process while also showing an example of what biomedical engineers think about.</p>
